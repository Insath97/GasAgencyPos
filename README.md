# Online Gas Agency Management System

## Overview

I orchestrated the development of an efficient Online Gas Agency Management System utilizing HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, PHP, and a MySQL database, with added Point of Sale (POS) functionality. This system revolutionized gas distribution across Sri Lanka. It encompassed a secure user authentication system, intuitive gas distribution management, and real-time POS capabilities. This project not only demonstrated my prowess in frontend and backend technologies but also highlighted my aptitude for crafting user-centered systems that optimize complex operations.

- **Real-Time POS**: Point of Sale functionality for processing transactions in real-time.
- **Role Management**: Different roles including admin, cashier, and manager with specific access controls.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes Bootstrap for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
- **Database Management**: MySQL database integration for robust data handling.
